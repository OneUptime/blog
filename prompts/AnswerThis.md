<QUESTION>

If you want to link to posts the link format is: 

https://oneuptime.com/blog/post/<POST>/view

For example:

https://oneuptime.com/blog/post/2025-03-13-power-of-three-how-small-teams-drive-big-results/view

You do not have to link to other posts if they are not relevant, only link when they are relevant. 

Plese make the answer short and summarize it well.
