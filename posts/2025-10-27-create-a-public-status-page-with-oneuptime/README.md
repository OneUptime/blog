Description: Step-by-step guidance to launch a branded public status page in OneUptime and keep customers informed about incidents and maintenance.

---

A public status page is the front door to your reliability program. With OneUptime you can publish live component health, incident timelines, and scheduled maintenance updates in minutes. This guide walks through the entire setup so your customers always know what is happening—and what you are doing about it.

---

## Before you start

- A OneUptime project with permission to manage status pages and incidents.
- Monitors or incidents already tracking the services you want to display.
- A branded logo, color palette, and optional custom domain ready to apply.
- Subscriber expectations (email, SMS, webhook) so you can configure notifications that match your communication standards.

## Step 1: Create the status page shell

1. In OneUptime, open **Project Settings → Status Pages** and select **Create Status Page**.
2. Give the page a recognizable name such as `Acme Cloud Status`.
3. Choose whether the page starts public or stays in draft until you review design.
4. Save. You now have a baseline page with default components and placeholder branding.

## Step 2: Model the services customers care about

1. Navigate to the new page and select **Resources**.
2. Create component groups (for example `Core Platform`, `APIs`, `Integrations`).
3. For each component, link relevant monitors or incident feeds so status changes update automatically.
4. Arrange the order to match how customers think about your product.

## Step 3: Brand the page

1. Open the **Branding** section and upload your logo and favicon.
2. Choose background and accent colors that complement your product UI.
3. Add custom footer and header links (documentation, support, security center) to help customers take the next step.
4. Set a friendly hero message such as “Real-time health for Acme Cloud services.”

## Step 4: Configure the domain and SSL

1. In **Domains**, add your preferred hostname (for example `status.acmecloud.com`).
2. Follow the DNS instructions to create the CNAME or A record pointing to OneUptime.
3. Once DNS propagates, OneUptime automatically provisions SSL certificates so visitors see a secure padlock.
4. Keep the default `oneuptime.com` link active while DNS changes propagate, then switch communication to the custom domain.

## Step 6: Enable subscriber notifications

1. From the **Subscribers** tab, enable email and SMS if you want customers to opt in for automated updates.
2. Customize confirmation and welcome messages so subscribers know what to expect.
3. Set throttling limits if you want to batch notifications for quieter updates.
4. Share the self-service subscription link in your help center, onboarding emails, and system banners.

---

## Step 7: Publish and announce

1. Preview the page to confirm layout, colors, and component order.
2. Toggle the status page to **Public** once you are ready.
3. Announce the page to customers—include the link in support macros, status signatures, and product notifications.
4. Add the link to your incident runbooks so responders post updates there by default.

## Everyday operations after launch

- Use **Announcements** for proactive customer messaging (for example billing migrations or network provider outages).
- Close incidents with a post-incident summary so the timeline remains useful even after recovery.
- Track subscriber growth and notification logs from the Status Page dashboard.
- Review historical availability charts monthly and share them with leadership or key accounts.

---

## Troubleshooting and tips

- **My components look empty:** Make sure each component links to at least one monitor or incident source so OneUptime can populate real-time data.
- **Incident updates feel repetitive:** Edit incident templates with reusable paragraphs so responders stay consistent without rewriting copy.
- **DNS is not resolving:** Double-check that the DNS record is proxied correctly (disable CDN orange clouds if required) and allow time for propagation.
- **Stakeholders still ping Slack:** Pin the status page link in your internal channels and teach teams to check it first.

---

## Keep improving over time

- Schedule quarterly reviews to align components with product changes and retire anything stale.
- Segment subscriber options (engineering, customer success, partners) to tailor messaging frequency.
- Pair the status page with Workspace Notification Rules so announcements also hit Microsoft Teams, Slack, or email lists.
- Use incident retrospectives to check whether updates were timely and clear—and capture lessons for your templates.

A polished status page proves you take transparency seriously. Once it is live, every incident update and maintenance notice becomes a chance to earn more trust.
