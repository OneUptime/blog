# The Internet Must Decentralize

Description: Yesterday's AWS outage was a reminder that resilience starts at the edges. Here's why the next era of the internet must be decentralized and self-hosted.

Yesterday's [AWS status page](https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status?ts=20251020) turned orange again. Threads on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45640838) filled with worried founders, support teams, and indie makers watching their services grind to a halt. One provider hiccuped, and half the internet lost its voice. **That is not resilience. That is fragility disguised as convenience.**

We spent the last decade centralizing everything into a few hyperscalers because it *felt* cheaper, faster, and safer. It works - until it does not. When a region blinks out, you inherit the blast radius of every other tenant sharing that control plane. Your "availability zone" becomes a shared fate, not a shield.

Decentralizing is not nostalgia for bare metal. It is a mandate to own the critical path of your business. Self-hosting your most important services means you control recovery, failover, and performance. It means you are not hostage to a single provider's outages, pricing changes, or policy shifts. When did having your own data on someone else's hardware become a business strategy?

This is why we double down on platforms you can run yourself. If you need a playbook for escaping cloud lock-in, start with [how we moved from AWS to bare metal](https://oneuptime.com/blog/post/2023-10-30-moving-from-aws-to-bare-metal/view) and build outward.

The cloud is still an incredible tool, but it should be a layer, not your single point of failure. The next generation of resilient businesses will treat hyperscalers as optional accelerators, not mandatory dependencies. Decentralize your architecture today so the next outage becomes a minor blip, not a business crisis.
