Description: A short thank-you to every DevOps and SRE team who keep the internet steady, even when hyperscalers stumble.

When AWS was down yesterday, it felt like half the internet held its breath. Dashboards went red, executives went wide-eyed, and a million "is it us?" questions fired across chat threads. Yet the moment the lights flickered, DevOps teams were already in motion—rerouting traffic, flipping failovers, nursing clusters back to health.

This is a love letter to the humans in the war rooms and on-call rotations. The ones who rehearse disaster so users never feel calamity. The ones who patch quietly at midnight, automate so others can sleep, and keep calm while a status page turns orange.

Their work rarely trends on social media because the best reliability is invisible. But every checkout that still completes, every patient record that stays accessible, every classroom that keeps streaming through an outage is proof that DevOps is the connective tissue of the digital world.

So here’s a brief, heartfelt thank you. When clouds wobble, you hold the line. When pagers scream, you answer. And when the rest of us refresh without a second thought, it’s because you already fought the fire.
