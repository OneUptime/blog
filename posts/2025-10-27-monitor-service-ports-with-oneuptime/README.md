Description: Learn how to configure port monitors in OneUptime so anyone can spot service outages quickly—without reading source code or writing scripts.

Databases, message brokers, SMTP servers, and custom apps all listen on specific ports. If a port stops accepting connections, the service is effectively down. OneUptime's port monitor gives you a simple, guided way to check that reachability and alert the right people fast.

## What port monitors do for you

- Confirm that the host and port you care about still respond to TCP connections.
- Measure response times so you can see sluggish behavior before outages.
- Trigger incidents and alerts automatically when a service goes offline.
- Share history and automation with every other monitor type in OneUptime.

## Create a port monitor in minutes

1. **Add a new monitor** and select **Port**.
2. **Name the monitor** clearly, such as "Postgres primary 5432" or "SMTP gateway".
3. **Enter the hostname or IP address**. The form checks the format for you.
4. **Specify the port number**. You can monitor anything from 22 and 80 through custom ports.
5. **Choose probe locations**. Use OneUptime probes for external visibility or self-hosted probes inside private networks.
6. **Pick how often to check**. Critical systems often run every minute; less critical services can be slower.
7. **Review the default alert rule** that fires when the port is offline. Add additional rules if you care about slow responses or repeated timeouts.
8. **Connect notifications** to on-call policies, chat tools, email, or workflows.
9. **Save** and watch the first result arrive on the monitor timeline.

## Everyday best practices

- Monitor every tier of a stack (database, cache, queue, app) so you know which dependency failed first.
- Pair port monitors with website or synthetic monitors to map symptoms to causes.
- Use maintenance windows to silence alerts during planned work like upgrades or certificate renewals.
- Group monitors by team or service in the dashboard to keep ownership clear.

## Troubleshooting without digging into code

- **Monitor shows offline, but you can connect manually?** Check firewall rules from the probe's viewpoint. External probes might be blocked even if your laptop is allowed.
- **Seeing repeated timeouts?** Increase the interval, require multiple failures before alerting, or create a separate rule that watches sustained timeouts.
- **Need a pause?** Switch the monitor to maintenance mode right from its detail page.

Port monitors close the gap between infrastructure checks and high-level user journeys. Set them up for every service whose downtime hurts, layer on your automations, and let OneUptime keep watch around the clock—no low-level debugging required.
