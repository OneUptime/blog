Description: Understand why every digital business needs a status page, how it protects trust, and when to roll one out in your reliability journey.

Customers forgive downtime faster than silence. A status page gives you a public place to acknowledge the issue, set expectations, and report progress. Even tiny teams can turn tense outages into honest conversations when the message is clear, timestamped, and easy to follow. Here is how a status page reshapes the experience for customers, executives, and engineers alike.

## What problems a status page actually solves

- **Stops the ticket flood**: When the page answers “Is it just me?” inbound support volume drops immediately.
- **Sets expectations in minutes**: Stakeholders can subscribe for email or SMS updates instead of chasing your team for timelines.
- **Documents the recovery story**: Each update becomes a transparent, time-stamped timeline that doubles as a post-incident artifact.
- **Protects your brand during the worst moments**: You control the narrative instead of leaving room for speculation on social media.

## Signals that it’s time to launch one

- You have paying customers or external SLAs and need to show how seriously you take uptime.
- Support has ever said, “We keep copying the same incident explanation into tickets.”
- You run scheduled maintenance and struggle to remind customers beforehand.
- Sales or customer success ask for “reliability proof” during procurement conversations.
- Regulators or enterprise buyers expect public transparency as part of due diligence.

## What great status pages include

- **Service components** broken into logical groups (API, Dashboard, Customer Webhooks, etc.) so readers see what’s impacted at a glance.
- **Historical uptime** charts to show trends over the last 30, 90, or 365 days.
- **Incident and maintenance timelines** that are easy to skim—updates, ownership, and next checkpoints.
- **Subscriber options** for Email, SMS, RSS, Slack, etc so audiences can choose how they stay informed.
- **Custom branding and domain** (for example `status.yourcompany.com`) so the page feels native to your product.

## How a status page helps every team

- **Support** links the page in autoresponders and shifts from repetitive replies to proactive, high-value conversations.
- **Customer success** shares the link with enterprise buyers to prove operational maturity.
- **Engineering and incident command** capture a single source of truth for recovery checkpoints and can reuse the timeline for postmortems.
- **Leadership** monitors real-time recovery progress without pinging the on-call channel.

## When to publish an update (and when not to)

- **Do post** when customers notice degraded experience, even if the root cause isn’t confirmed yet. Transparency beats certainty.
- **Do post** scheduled maintenance at least a week in advance, plus reminders the day before and fifteen minutes before start.
- **Do update** at predictable intervals (for example every 30 minutes) during ongoing incidents, even if the message is “still investigating.”
- **Don’t post** transient hiccups that self-resolve in seconds unless they breach your SLOs.
- **Don’t wait** until the fix ships—communicate the moment you recognize customer impact.

## Getting ready inside OneUptime

1. Map your services into OneUptime monitors and components so the status page reflects the same taxonomy.
2. Draft default incident and maintenance templates so responders know the tone and detail level to publish.
3. Configure subscriber notification rules (email, SMS, Microsoft Teams, Slack) to match customer expectations.
4. Choose a custom domain and upload your logo/theme to keep messaging on brand.
5. Preview the page in staging and run a tabletop exercise: simulate an outage, publish updates, and review what worked.

## Common misconceptions (and why they’re wrong)

- **“We will launch one after the product is stable.”** Reliability is a journey; the page proves you are invested even when hiccups happen.
- **“Customers will panic if they see our incident history.”** They already know when things break. Seeing honest timelines builds trust.
- **“It’s too much work for a small team.”** OneUptime automates updates from incidents and maintenance events, so the operational burden stays low.
- **“Sales will lose deals if prospects see downtime.”** The opposite: enterprise buyers expect transparency and reward vendors who communicate.

## What “good” looks like

- Clear, plain-language updates that explain scope, impact, and next checkpoint.
- Dedicated sections for past incidents, upcoming maintenance, and current status.
- Sub-30-minute response time from detection to first status page update.
- Post-incident summary added within 24 hours to capture the root cause and remediation work.

## Your next step

If you already run monitors and incident workflows in OneUptime, you are a few clicks away from publishing a status page. Start with a simple layout, announce it internally, and then let customers know where to check first the next time something looks off. The tool keeps everyone informed; your team earns the trust.
