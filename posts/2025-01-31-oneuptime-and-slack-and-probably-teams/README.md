Description: Learn how to use workflows to send messages to Slack when incidents are created or updated.

## Getting Alerted

A very common use-case for alerting people to incidents is sending them into Slack. Less common is sending them into Teams, but it's still largely the same process. We spend most of our day working with our peers and colleagues in Slack. There's a million and one Slack plugins and bots that alert you to meetings, company comms or whose turn it is to make the tea.

So why not get the fear inducing incident alerts there too?

## A muppets guide to getting the right data out of OneUptime and into Slack.

1. You'll want to create workflow and select the `On Create Incident` trigger.
2. In the "Selected Fields" box, add the following
```
{
    "monitors": {
      "name":true
    },
    "currentIncidentState": {
        "name": true
    },
    "incidentSeverity": {
        "name": true
    },
    "createdAt": true,
    "title" : true,
    "description" : true,
    "_id" : true,
    "projectId" : true
}
```
3. Next, select the `Send Message to Slack` component.
4. Fill in the "Slack Incoming Webhook URL" with your Slack bot webhook (if you haven't got one of those, watch this video [Connect OneUptime to Slack using Workflows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1-reCQTZnM))
5. In the "Message Text" box, add the following:
```
ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨
*{{local.components.incident-on-create-1.returnValues.model.incidentSeverity.name}} Declared*

Incident State: `{{local.components.incident-on-create-1.returnValues.model.currentIncidentState.name}}`
Incident Title: *{{local.components.incident-on-create-1.returnValues.model.title}}*
Date: {{local.components.incident-on-create-1.returnValues.model.createdAt.value}}
Monitor: `{{local.components.incident-on-create-1.returnValues.model.monitors[0].name}}`

Description: 
---
{{local.components.incident-on-create-1.returnValues.model.description}}
---

```
6. Make sure you connect all the components with the drag and drop connectors.

## In Slack

It will look like this in Slack:

Obviously you can change how it looks, move stuff around and whatnot. If you're a Slack bot pro, you can probably even create buttons to Acknowledge or Resolve requests.

## Updating Slack with incident status changes
Your incidents will auto-resolve themselves when the monitor goes back into an operational state, or someone clicks 'Acknowledge' in the interface. You can also get these pushed into Slack with the following mumbo jumbo:

1. Create a new workflow and set the trigger as `On Create Incident State Timeline` (yeah, it's not most obvious name).
2. In the "Select Fields" box in the trigger, add the following:
```
{
    "createdAt": true,
    "incident" : {
      "title" : true
    },
    "incidentState" : {
      "name" : true
    },
    "_id" : true,
    "rootCause" : true,
    "createdByUser": true
}
```
3. Now, if you don't want to have the `Identified` incident status appear (which you may not, as the first workflow will post the incident and this one will also post it), then add an `If/Else` component and put `{{local.components.incident-state-timeline-on-create-1.returnValues.model.incidentState.name}}` in the "Input 1" box, `Equal To` in the "Operator" and `Identified` in the "Input 2 box". Hit save.

4. Connect the trigger to `If/Else` (if you added it)

5. Add a `Send Message to Slack` component, add the same Slack webhook as before, and the following in the "Message Text" box:

```
  ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨
*[{{local.components.incident-state-timeline-on-create-1.returnValues.model.incident.title}}] State Changed!*

New State: `{{local.components.incident-state-timeline-on-create-1.returnValues.model.incidentState.name}}`
Date: {{local.components.incident-state-timeline-on-create-1.returnValues.model.createdAt.value}}
Incident Title: {{local.components.incident-state-timeline-on-create-1.returnValues.model.incident.title}}

Cause of change:
---
 {{local.components.incident-state-timeline-on-create-1.returnValues.model.rootCause}}
---

ğŸ‘€ See more here: 
https://oneuptime.com/dashboard/{{local.components.incident-state-timeline-on-create-1.returnValues.model.projectId.value}}/incidents/{{local.components.incident-state-timeline-on-create-1.returnValues.model._id}} 

```

6. Connect the `No` part of the `If/Else` component to the Slack component.
7. Now you'll get updates to the incident posted to the Slack channel too. Hurrah

## Connecting to Teams...

.. is exactly the, but replace the Slack component with the Teams one.
