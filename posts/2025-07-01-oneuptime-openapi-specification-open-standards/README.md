Description: OneUptime now provides a comprehensive OpenAPI 3.0 specification covering our entire API surface. This commitment to open standards enables seamless integrations, third-party tool development, and demonstrates our dedication to interoperability in the open source ecosystem.

Today, we're excited to announce that **OneUptime now provides a complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification** for our entire API surface. This isn't just about documentation‚Äîit's a fundamental commitment to open standards, interoperability, and empowering the developer community to build on top of our platform.

## Why OpenAPI Matters for Open Source

OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) represents more than just API documentation‚Äîit's a **universal language for APIs**. By adopting this open standard, OneUptime joins the ranks of forward-thinking companies that believe in:

- **Transparency**: Every endpoint, parameter, and response is clearly documented
- **Interoperability**: Standard formats enable seamless integration with any tool or platform
- **Developer Experience**: Auto-generated SDKs, interactive documentation, and code samples
- **Community Empowerment**: Third-party developers can build tools, integrations, and extensions

As an open source observability platform, providing an OpenAPI specification isn't just good practice‚Äîit's essential for fostering an ecosystem where developers can innovate without barriers.

        host="https://oneuptime.com/api",
        api_key={'ApiKey': 'your-api-key'}
    )
)

# Create an incident when your custom monitoring detects an issue
incident_api = oneuptime_client.IncidentApi(client)
incident = incident_api.create_incident({
    "title": "Database Connection Timeout",
    "description": "Unable to connect to primary database",
    "severity_id": "critical-severity-id"
