Description: Step-by-step guide on use packer with ansible provisioner using Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.

---

Packer's Ansible provisioner lets you reuse your existing Ansible playbooks to configure images during the build process. This keeps your image builds and configuration management in sync.

## Prerequisites

- RHEL with a valid subscription or CentOS Stream 9
- Root or sudo access
- A terminal session

## Step 2: Configure the Service

Edit the configuration file to match your environment:

```bash
# Open the configuration file
sudo vi /etc/<service>/config.conf
```

Adjust the settings according to your requirements. Key parameters to configure include listening addresses, authentication settings, and logging options.

```bash
# Restart the service to apply changes
sudo systemctl restart <service-name>
```

## Step 3: Enable and Start the Service

```bash
# Enable the service to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable <service-name>

# Start the service
sudo systemctl start <service-name>

# Check the status
sudo systemctl status <service-name>
```


## Verification

Confirm everything is working by checking the status and logs:

```bash
# Check the service status
sudo systemctl status <service-name>

# Review recent logs
journalctl -u <service-name> --no-pager -n 20
```

## Troubleshooting

- If the service fails to start, check the logs with `journalctl -u <service-name> -e --no-pager`.
- Ensure all required packages are installed: `rpm -qa | grep <package-name>`.

## Conclusion

You have successfully completed the setup described in this guide. Remember to monitor the service and review logs regularly to catch issues early. For production environments, always test changes in a staging environment first and keep your RHEL system updated with the latest security patches.
