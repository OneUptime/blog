# Why diversify away from AWS us-east-1

Description: AWS us-east-1 keeps proving that a single cheap, default region can hospitalise your entire business. Here's why it fails so loudly, how the blast radius reaches far beyond Virginia, and what to do if you still have workloads anchored there.

On October 20, 2025, us-east-1 melted down again. DynamoDB's control plane started returning poison DNS responses, network load balancers throttled launches, and teams across the planet were locked out of the AWS console because Identity Center lived only in Virginia. Snowflake, Twilio, Slack huddles, CircleCI, countless internal tools and even consumer devices like Ring doorbells all blipped at the same time. If you were single-homed in us-east-1, you spent the day in incident bridges. If you were multi-region on paper but your auth stack or ticketing system still pointed at Virginia, failover didn't happen.

> "We architected for multi-region, but we couldn't execute failover because the control plane that grants access was stuck in us-east-1." - common refrain in this week's postmortems

The repeated lesson is simple: **us-east-1 is the wrong place to anchor anything mission critical**. Let's unpack why.

## 1. Control Planes and Global Services Still Live There

IAM, Identity Center, parts of Route 53, CloudFront certificate issuance, Lambda@Edge deployments, and billing are all materially tied to us-east-1. Those systems replicate data outward, but write paths and break-glass credentials originate in Virginia. When a DNS subsystem or auth stack chokes there, the rest of the world inherits the outage—even if your application stack is happily running in eu-west-1 or ap-southeast-2.

During the latest incident:

- Multi-region-ready teams could not assume roles or promote Route 53 failover records because IAM and STS calls stalled.
- Organizations that recently migrated to Identity Center discovered they had centralised access in a single region, effectively locking their staff out of the AWS console.
- Even root credentials were trapped in vault workflows dependent on the same region.

If your recovery plan contains the line "log into the console and flip traffic", you do not have a recovery plan.

## 2. It Is the Largest, Noisiest Change Window in AWS

us-east-1 is the oldest region, the largest fleet of EC2 hosts, and the launch pad for almost every new AWS feature or hardware generation. That combination guarantees constant change. Engineers inside AWS have admitted for years that edge cases surface there first simply because of scale. Legacy subsystems, multi-decade load balancers, and experimental deployments coexist.

That matters because:

- Deployment trains often end in us-east-1; when mitigation rolls back elsewhere, Virginia is still converging.
- Internal dependencies (think internal Dynamo variants, monitoring platforms, ticketing systems) rely on the original region and introduce loops.
- Regional capacity pressure means AWS throttles instance launches during recovery, so your auto scaling group starves even though compute is healthy in another region.

In other words, **you volunteer to be the canary flock** every time you choose the default dropdown.

## 3. The Blast Radius Includes Your Vendors

You may have zero production nodes in Virginia and still go down because SaaS providers you depend on are parked there. This outage knocked over:

- CI/CD (CircleCI, GitHub Actions runners, Heroku pipeline workers)
- Observability stacks (Datadog ingestion, Snowflake warehouses, Elasticache metrics)
- Messaging and auth services (Twilio SMS, Slack huddles, Okta integrations)
- Consumer and IoT experiences (Ring, smart routers, airline Wi-Fi logins)

Correlated outages are worse than isolated ones. When your payment processor, ticketing portal, and SMS 2FA provider all share us-east-1, your "independent" redundancy disappears.

Action item: maintain a vendor dependency inventory that includes hosting region and failover posture. Assume that if they say "global", they probably mean "us-east-1 plus caches".

## 4. Economics and Defaults Keep You Trapped

Teams stay in us-east-1 for four reasons:

1. **Cheaper on paper**: list prices in us-east-1 are a hair lower than us-west-1 and parity with us-east-2, but data transfer and downtime dwarfs the savings.
2. **Default in tooling**: Terraform, CDK, AWS SDKs, tutorials, AI-generated snippets, even `aws configure` all default to us-east-1.
3. **Feature firsts**: new Bedrock models, Nitro generations, or IoT products appear in Virginia months before anywhere else.
4. **Data gravity**: partners and Direct Connect facilities cluster around Northern Virginia, so hybrid shops follow.

The result? Entire companies accept six-to-eight-hour brownouts every couple of years rather than budget the engineering work to leave. But the longer you defer, the harder the migration becomes.

## Getting Out of the Blast Zone

Escaping us-east-1 is not a weekend refactor, but it is also not optional anymore. Here is how to approach it pragmatically:

### 1. Decouple Identity and Access First

- Stand up Identity Center or your IdP in a second region; force console logins through regional endpoints (e.g., `https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com`).
- Pre-provision break-glass roles with long-lived credentials stored outside AWS (hardware tokens, secure vaults) and test them quarterly.
- Regionally scope STS endpoints in every SDK and CLI (`sts.us-east-2.amazonaws.com` etc.) so auth keeps working when the global endpoint stalls.

### 2. Move Stateful Systems Off Virginia

- Promote another region as primary for production traffic. Treat us-east-1 as cold standby, not active-active.
- For DynamoDB or Aurora, enable global tables or read replicas where the write region is *not* us-east-1, then cut over during a planned maintenance window.
- Rebuild S3 buckets with cross-region replication in the opposite direction—you will discover hardcoded ARNs and event targets the first time you try.

### 3. Test Runbooks, Not Just Architecture Diagrams

- Run chaos days that deliberately block console and IAM access, forcing teams to operate from a secondary region.
- Simulate loss of vendor APIs that live in Virginia (SMS, CI, logging). Validate that your alerts, incident tooling, and customer comms still function.
- Track failover Mean Time To Execute (MTTE) and make it a reliability objective.

### 4. Diversify Third-Party Dependencies

- Ask vendors for their regional topology and SLA by region; write it into contracts.
- Prefer providers that are multi-cloud or offer on-prem/edge options (e.g., self-hosted auth, open-source observability pipelines).
- Mirror critical SaaS exports (billing, CRM, alert history) to systems you control so you can operate in "offline mode" during their outages.

> Reliability is the sum of *your* systems plus every dependency you unknowingly bundled into your architecture.

## Making the Business Case

Leadership pushback usually sounds like "everyone else was down too" or "we can't afford multi-region". Flip the conversation:

- Model the real cost of the last us-east-1 outage: lost transactions, SLA penalties, staff overtime, delayed product launches, reputational damage.
- Compare it with a phased migration budget: weeks of engineering time to replicate infrastructure, incremental data transfer during cutover, higher list price in us-east-2 (which is usually zero).
- Highlight compliance and resilience requirements already on the horizon (financial regulators, cyber insurance, SOC2). Multi-region is rarely optional for long.

When the board asks how you will avoid a repeat, "we trusted AWS" is not a satisfying answer.

## Bottom Line

us-east-1 is still the beating heart of AWS. That is exactly why you should treat it as the region of last resort. Keep a footprint there only when a service is literally unavailable anywhere else, and cordon it off behind strict runbooks. For everything else, move your primary workloads, identity stack, and vendor choices away from Virginia before the next outage forces your hand.
