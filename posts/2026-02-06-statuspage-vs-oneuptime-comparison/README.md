Description: Comparing Atlassian StatusPage.io with OneUptime - features, pricing, and why open-source status pages are gaining ground in 2026.

Status pages have become essential for any company that cares about customer trust. When something goes wrong, your users want to know: Is it down? What's affected? When will it be fixed?

Atlassian's StatusPage.io has dominated this space for years. But as pricing climbs and teams demand more integrated solutions, alternatives like OneUptime are gaining serious traction. Let's break down the comparison.

## What StatusPage.io Does Well

StatusPage.io, acquired by Atlassian in 2016, built its reputation on:

**Beautiful, professional status pages.** Their templates look polished out of the box. For companies that want a status page live in 30 minutes, it delivers.

**Subscriber management.** Users can subscribe to updates via email, SMS, webhook, or RSS. When you post an incident, subscribers get notified automatically.

**Atlassian ecosystem integration.** If you're already using Jira, Confluence, and Opsgenie, StatusPage.io fits naturally into your workflow.

## The StatusPage.io Problem

### 1. It's Just a Status Page

StatusPage.io is *only* a status page. It doesn't monitor your services, alert your team, provide logs, or track errors. You need additional tools for all of that.

Your incident workflow ends up spanning 3+ tools with manual handoffs between them.

### 2. Pricing Adds Up Fast

StatusPage.io pricing in 2026:

| Plan | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Hobby | $29/month | 1 team member, 250 subscribers |
| Startup | $99/month | 5 members, 1,000 subscribers |
| Business | $399/month | Unlimited members, 5,000 subscribers |
| Enterprise | Custom | 25,000+ subscribers, SLA |

Add Opsgenie for alerting and Pingdom for monitoring, and a 10-person team easily pays $800+/month.

### 3. Vendor Lock-in

Once your subscribers are in StatusPage.io, migrating is painful. Most teams just stay.

## Why Teams Choose OneUptime Instead

### 1. Everything in One Platform

OneUptime includes status pages, monitoring, incidents, on-call, logs, metrics, traces, and error tracking-all unified.

### 2. Transparent, Inclusive Pricing

OneUptime Growth at $99/month includes unlimited everything. That's 40%+ cheaper than the StatusPage.io stack alone.

### 3. Open Source & Self-Hosted

OneUptime is 100% open source (MIT license). Self-host on your infrastructure with full control.

### 4. Automatic Status Updates

Your status page updates automatically based on monitor status. No manual intervention required.

## The Verdict

**StatusPage.io** is a polished status page product. But that's all it is.

**OneUptime** is a complete reliability platform in one open-source package.
