Description: Master Trivy integration with Harbor for automated container image vulnerability scanning and security analysis.

---

Harbor integrates with Trivy for comprehensive vulnerability scanning. Configure automatic scanning on image push, set severity thresholds, and block deployments of vulnerable images. Trivy scans OS packages, application dependencies, and configuration files. Review scan results in Harbor UI, export reports, and set up webhook notifications for critical vulnerabilities. Implement policy-based controls to prevent deployment of images with high-severity CVEs. This provides continuous security monitoring for your container supply chain.
