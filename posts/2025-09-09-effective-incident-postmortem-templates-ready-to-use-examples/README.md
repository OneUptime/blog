Description: Master incident postmortems with these ready-to-use templates. Learn how to structure effective postmortems to improve reliability and prevent future incidents.

In the world of software engineering and site reliability engineering (SRE), incidents are inevitable. But what separates high-performing teams from the rest is how they learn from these incidents. Incident postmortems are the cornerstone of continuous improvement, turning failures into opportunities for growth.

Here are some ready-to-use templates for conducting effective incident postmortems. We'll cover the basics of what makes a good postmortem, why they're crucial, and provide multiple template options to suit different needs.

## Why Incident Postmortems Matter

Postmortems serve several critical purposes:

- **Prevent Recurrence**: Identify root causes and implement fixes to avoid similar incidents.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Distribute learnings across teams and the organization.
- **Process Improvement**: Refine incident response procedures and tooling.
- **Cultural Growth**: Foster a blameless culture focused on systems, not individuals.


## Key Principles for Effective Postmortems

Before diving into templates, remember these principles:

1. **Blameless**: Focus on systems and processes, not individuals.
2. **Timely**: Conduct postmortems while details are fresh, ideally within 48-72 hours.
3. **Actionable**: Include specific, measurable action items with owners and deadlines.
4. **Comprehensive**: Cover what happened, why, and how to prevent it.
5. **Shared**: Make postmortems accessible to relevant stakeholders.

## Basic Incident Postmortem Template

This simple template is perfect for quick reviews of minor incidents or as a starting point for teams new to postmortems.

### 1. Incident Summary
- **Date and Time**: When did the incident occur?
- **Duration**: How long did it last?
- **Impact**: Who was affected? What was the user/business impact?
- **Severity**: (Low/Medium/High/Critical)

### 2. Timeline
- **Detection**: When and how was the incident detected?
- **Response**: Key actions taken during the incident
- **Resolution**: When and how was the incident resolved?

### 3. Root Cause Analysis
- **What happened?**: Brief description of the incident
- **Why did it happen?**: Root cause(s) identified
- **Contributing factors**: Any secondary causes

### 4. Action Items
- **Immediate fixes**: What was done to resolve the incident?
- **Preventive measures**: What will be done to prevent recurrence?
- **Owner**: Who is responsible for each action?
- **Deadline**: When should each action be completed?

### 5. Lessons Learned
- **What went well?**: Positive aspects of the response
- **What could be improved?**: Areas for future enhancement
- **Follow-up**: How will we track progress on action items?

## Detailed Incident Postmortem Template

For more complex incidents or mature teams, this comprehensive template provides deeper analysis.

### 1. Executive Summary
- **Incident Overview**: High-level description
- **Impact Assessment**: Quantitative and qualitative impact
- **Timeline Summary**: Key milestones
- **Recommendations**: Top 3-5 action items

### 2. Incident Details
- **Detection and Discovery**
  - How was the incident detected?
  - Initial assessment and triage
- **Impact Analysis**
  - Affected systems/services
  - User impact (number of users, duration of outage, etc.)
  - Business impact (revenue loss, SLA violations, etc.)
- **Response Timeline**
  - Detailed chronological events
  - Key decisions and actions
  - Communication updates

### 3. Root Cause Analysis
- **Methodology Used**: (5 Whys, Fishbone Diagram, etc.)
- **Primary Root Cause**: The fundamental cause
- **Contributing Factors**: Secondary causes and conditions
- **Evidence**: Logs, metrics, screenshots, etc.

### 4. Recovery and Resolution
- **Resolution Steps**: How the incident was fixed
- **Verification**: How resolution was confirmed
- **Rollback Plan**: If applicable

### 5. Prevention and Improvement
- **Action Items**
  - Short-term fixes
  - Long-term improvements
  - Monitoring enhancements
  - Process changes
- **Risk Assessment**: Likelihood and impact of similar incidents
- **Testing Recommendations**: How to validate fixes

### 6. Communication and Documentation
- **Internal Communication**: What was shared with the team?
- **External Communication**: Status page updates, customer notifications
- **Documentation Updates**: Runbooks, playbooks, knowledge base

### 7. Retrospective
- **What Went Well**: Successful aspects of response
- **What Didn't Go Well**: Challenges and failures
- **Lessons Learned**: Key takeaways
- **Process Improvements**: Changes to incident response procedures

## Specialized Templates

### Security Incident Postmortem Template

For incidents involving security breaches or vulnerabilities:

- **Compromised Assets**: What was affected?
- **Attack Vector**: How did the breach occur?
- **Data Exposure**: What information was at risk?
- **Compliance Impact**: Any regulatory implications?
- **Forensic Analysis**: Detailed investigation findings
- **Remediation Steps**: Security fixes and patches

### Performance Degradation Postmortem Template

For incidents related to system performance issues:

- **Performance Metrics**: CPU, memory, latency, throughput
- **Thresholds Breached**: Which alerts were triggered?
- **Load Analysis**: Traffic patterns during the incident
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Where was the performance issue?
- **Scaling Response**: Auto-scaling behavior
- **Optimization Recommendations**: Code, infrastructure, or configuration changes

## Tips for Using These Templates

1. **Customize**: Adapt templates to your organization's needs and incident types.
2. **Collaborate**: Involve cross-functional teams in the postmortem process.
3. **Follow Up**: Schedule regular check-ins on action item progress.
4. **Measure Success**: Track metrics like MTTR (Mean Time to Resolution) and incident recurrence rates.
5. **Evolve**: Regularly review and improve your postmortem process.
