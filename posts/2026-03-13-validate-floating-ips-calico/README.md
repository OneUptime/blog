## Introduction

Floating IPs with Calico provides important IP address management capabilities in Calico. This feature allows for fine-grained control over how IP addresses are assigned to pods in your Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

- Calico v3.20+ installed
- kubectl and calicoctl access
- IP pools configured

## Configuration

```bash
calicoctl get ippools -o yaml
calicoctl ipam show --show-blocks
```

## Example

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: IPPool
metadata:
  name: example-pool
spec:
  cidr: 10.48.0.0/16
  blockSize: 26
  natOutgoing: true
```

## Verification

```bash
calicoctl ipam check -o ipam-report.json
kubectl get pods -A -o wide
```

## Architecture

## Conclusion

How to Validate Floating IPs with Calico helps ensure your Calico deployment handles IP addressing correctly for your specific workload requirements.
