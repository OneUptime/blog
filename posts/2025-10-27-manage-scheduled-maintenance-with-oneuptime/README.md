Description: A no-surprises guide to planning, approving, and communicating scheduled maintenance in OneUptime so customers and internal teams stay aligned.

Scheduled maintenance should feel routine—not chaotic. OneUptime centralizes planning, approvals, notifications, and customer updates so every maintenance window is documented and predictable. This playbook walks through the workflow from drafting a plan to closing with a clear post-maintenance summary.

## Why run maintenance through OneUptime?

- Keep the entire timeline—announcement, reminders, execution, and wrap-up—in one place.
- Notify customers and internal teams across channels (status page, email, SMS, Slack, Microsoft Teams) without duplicating effort.
- Coordinate owners, runbooks, and dependencies up front to cut downtime and surprises.
- Capture history to prove compliance and show how often maintenance happens.

## Before you start

- Confirm your OneUptime project has monitors tied to the services being updated.
- Decide who approves maintenance windows and who writes customer-facing messages.
- Draft a lightweight runbook outlining steps, rollback plan, and success checks.
- If you run a public or private status page, verify branding and subscriber settings are current.

## Step-by-step maintenance workflow

1. **Create the event**
   - Go to **Scheduled Maintenance → Create Maintenance**.
   - Name the window, set start and end times (including timezone), and choose the affected monitors or service components.
   - Attach related runbooks or documentation so on-call teams know exactly what to follow.

2. **Assign ownership**
   - Add the primary owner, escalation teams, or individual engineers responsible for executing the plan.
   - Include stakeholders (support, customer success) so they receive internal notifications.

3. **Craft the communication plan**
   - Write customer-friendly templates for the three major milestones: announcement, maintenance start, and completion.
   - Customize internal notes if you need extra technical detail separate from the public message.

4. **Schedule notifications**
   - Enable automated reminders: for example one week before, 24 hours before, and 15 minutes before the window begins.
   - Choose channels: status page, email/SMS subscribers, Workspace Connections (Slack, Microsoft Teams), and internal notification rules.

5. **Review and approve**
   - Use the approval workflow so leadership or change advisory boards sign off before the window locks in.
   - Once approved, the event appears on your status page (if configured) with a clear timeline.

6. **Execute the plan**
   - When maintenance starts, OneUptime flips the status page component state automatically (or prompts the owner to confirm).
   - Responders can post live updates, mark checkpoints, or log issues encountered during the window.

7. **Close with a summary**
   - As soon as maintenance completes, publish the final update and confirm all services are operational.
   - Document any deviations, unexpected impact, or follow-up tasks.
   - OneUptime archives the event for reporting, so you can revisit details later.

## Tips for smooth maintenance windows

- **Align time zones**: Always display the maintenance window in both your internal timezone and the customer’s primary region.
- **Limit scope creep**: Freeze changes the day before; any new work becomes a separate event.
- **Automate verification**: Tie monitors or synthetic checks to the plan so you know instantly when systems are ready to go live again.
- **Practice the rollback**: If a step fails, you should know the exact triggers that send the plan into rollback mode.

## How communication flows across channels

- **Status Page**: Public or private pages show the maintenance banner with live updates.
- **Subscribers**: Email and SMS followers receive every update you publish, keeping them informed without manual blasts.
- **Workspace Connections**: Slack or Microsoft Teams channels receive adaptive cards so internal responders and stakeholders can react in real time.
- **Incident Automation**: If monitors detect unexpected downtime, OneUptime can raise an incident linked to the maintenance window for faster triage.

## Reporting and follow-up

- Review the maintenance history to track frequency, duration, and customer communication scores.
- Export transcripts for compliance reviews or share them with partners who require change management logs.
- Use the history to inform status page subscribers about recurring maintenance windows and build trust through predictability.

---

## Keep improving the process

- Run a quick retro after each window: what worked, what did not, and what scripts should be updated.
- Update notification templates with clearer impact statements based on customer feedback.
- Link maintenance events to your Service Catalog so owners see dependencies before making changes.
- Share the calendar internally so product and support teams align other launches around your maintenance timeline.

Planned downtime is still downtime—but with OneUptime, it becomes a well-orchestrated event that keeps customers confident and teams calm.
