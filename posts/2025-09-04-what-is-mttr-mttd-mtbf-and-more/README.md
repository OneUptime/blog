# Understanding MTTR, MTTD, MTBF and the Complete Reliability Lexicon

In the world of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), metrics are the compass that guides our reliability journey. While Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) often steals the spotlight, it's just one piece of a much larger puzzle. Understanding the complete lexicon of SRE metrics is crucial for building robust, reliable systems that users can depend on.

This comprehensive guide will decode the essential SRE terminology that every engineer and engineering manager should know, from the foundational metrics like MTTR and MTTD to advanced concepts that shape modern reliability practices.

## The Foundation: The Four Pillars of SRE Metrics

### 1. MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery/Repair)

**Definition**: The average time it takes to restore a system or service to full functionality after a failure occurs.

MTTR is calculated as:
```
MTTR = Total Downtime / Number of Incidents
```

**Why it matters**: MTTR directly impacts customer experience and business outcomes. A lower MTTR means faster recovery from outages, reducing the blast radius of incidents.

**Best practices**:
- Automate incident detection and response workflows
- Maintain comprehensive runbooks for common scenarios
- Implement circuit breakers and graceful degradation
- Practice incident response through chaos engineering

**What good looks like**: Industry leaders typically maintain MTTR under 30 minutes for critical services, with some achieving sub-5-minute recovery times through heavy automation.

### 2. MTTD (Mean Time To Detection)

**Definition**: The average time between when an incident occurs and when it's first detected by your monitoring systems or team.

MTTD formula:
```
MTTD = Total Time from Incident Start to Detection / Number of Incidents
```

**Why it matters**: You can't fix what you don't know is broken. MTTD is often the hidden bottleneck in incident response—the faster you detect issues, the faster you can begin recovery.

**Optimization strategies**:
- Implement comprehensive [observability](https://oneuptime.com/blog/post/2025-08-21-logs-traces-metrics-before-and-after/view) with metrics, logs, and traces
- Use synthetic monitoring to catch issues before users do
- Set up intelligent alerting that reduces noise while maintaining coverage
- Deploy health checks at multiple system layers

**Industry benchmarks**: Top-performing teams achieve MTTD under 5 minutes for critical failures, often through proactive monitoring that detects anomalies before they become outages.

### 3. MTTF (Mean Time To Failure)

**Definition**: The average time a system operates without failure. This metric applies to non-repairable systems or the time between repairs for repairable systems.

**Why it matters**: MTTF helps predict system reliability and plan maintenance windows. It's particularly useful for capacity planning and determining when components need replacement.

**How to improve it**:
- Implement redundancy and failover mechanisms
- Regular maintenance and updates
- Monitor system health and performance trends
- Use quality components and proven architectures

### 4. MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)

**Definition**: The average time between system failures, including both operational time and repair time.

MTBF calculation:
```
MTBF = (Total Operational Time) / (Number of Failures)
```

**Distinction from MTTF**: While MTTF measures time to first failure, MTBF includes the full cycle of operation, failure, repair, and return to operation.


### Error Budgets

**Definition**: The amount of unreliability your service can tolerate before it impacts user experience, typically expressed as a percentage of allowed downtime.

Error budgets bridge the gap between reliability and feature velocity. They're calculated based on your Service Level Objectives (SLOs):

```
Error Budget = 100% - SLO
```

For example, a 99.9% availability SLO means you have a 0.1% error budget—roughly 43 minutes of downtime per month.

### Service Level Indicators (SLIs)

**Definition**: Quantitative measures of service level, such as request latency, error rate, or throughput.

Common SLIs include:
- **Availability**: Percentage of successful requests
- **Latency**: Response time percentiles (P50, P95, P99)
- **Throughput**: Requests per second
- **Quality**: Error rates or data accuracy

### Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

**Definition**: Target values or ranges for SLIs that define the desired reliability of a service.

Example SLOs:
- 99.9% of requests complete successfully
- 95% of requests complete within 200ms
- 99% of requests complete within 1 second

### Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

**Definition**: Business contracts that specify the consequences of not meeting SLOs, typically including financial penalties or service credits.

SLAs are external-facing commitments to customers, while SLOs are internal targets that should be stricter than SLAs to provide a buffer.

## Operational Excellence Metrics

### Change Failure Rate

**Definition**: The percentage of deployments that result in degraded service requiring immediate remediation.

```
Change Failure Rate = (Failed Changes / Total Changes) × 100
```

**Industry targets**: High-performing teams maintain change failure rates below 15%, with elite performers achieving rates below 5%.

### Deployment Frequency

**Definition**: How often your team successfully releases code to production.

This metric correlates strongly with overall development velocity and organizational maturity. Teams that deploy more frequently typically have better reliability practices.

### Lead Time for Changes

**Definition**: The time from code committed to code successfully running in production.

Shorter lead times enable faster feedback loops and reduce the risk of large, complex changes that are harder to debug when they fail.

### Recovery Rate

**Definition**: The success rate of recovery attempts during incidents.

```
Recovery Rate = (Successful Recoveries / Total Recovery Attempts) × 100
```

A low recovery rate might indicate inadequate runbooks, insufficient automation, or system design issues.

## Reliability Anti-Patterns: Metrics to Avoid

### Availability Theater

Focusing solely on uptime percentages without considering user experience. A service might be "up" but completely unusable due to high latency or error rates.

### MTTR Obsession

While important, optimizing only for MTTR can lead to band-aid fixes that don't address root causes, creating technical debt and recurring incidents.

### Alert Fatigue Metrics

Measuring alert volume without considering alert quality leads to teams ignoring important notifications buried in noise.

## Advanced Reliability Concepts

### Blast Radius

**Definition**: The scope of impact when a failure occurs, measured in users affected, services impacted, or business value at risk.

Reducing blast radius through:
- Microservices architecture
- Circuit breakers and bulkheads
- Gradual rollouts and feature flags
- Geographic distribution

### Error Budget Burn Rate

**Definition**: The rate at which you're consuming your error budget, helping predict when you might exhaust it.

Fast burn rates trigger emergency responses, while slow burn rates allow for continued feature development.

### Time to Mitigation vs. Time to Resolution

- **Mitigation**: Stopping the bleeding (restoring service)
- **Resolution**: Fixing the root cause (preventing recurrence)

Understanding this distinction helps prioritize incident response efforts and post-incident follow-up.


## Conclusion: Beyond MTTR to Holistic Reliability

While MTTR remains an important metric, modern SRE practices require a holistic approach to reliability measurement. The most successful teams don't just track individual metrics—they build comprehensive observability into their systems and use data-driven approaches to continuously improve reliability.

The key is starting with metrics that matter most to your users and business, then gradually expanding your measurement capabilities as your SRE practice matures. Remember that metrics are tools for improvement, not goals in themselves.

Focus on building systems that fail gracefully, recover quickly, and learn from every incident. With the right metrics and the right culture, you can build reliability that becomes a competitive advantage rather than just a cost center.
