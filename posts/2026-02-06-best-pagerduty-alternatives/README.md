Description: Looking for a PagerDuty alternative? Compare the top 10 incident management platforms including open-source options, pricing, and features.

PagerDuty has been a leader in incident management and on-call scheduling for years. But with pricing that starts at $21/user/month and quickly scales into hundreds of dollars per user for enterprise features, many teams are looking for alternatives that offer better value.

Whether you need a more affordable solution, want open-source flexibility, or simply need different features, there are excellent PagerDuty alternatives available. Here are the 10 best options in 2026.

## Why Teams Are Switching from PagerDuty

Before diving into alternatives, let's understand why teams consider switching:

- **Cost**: PagerDuty's pricing scales with users, making it expensive for growing teams
- **Feature overlap**: Many teams use multiple tools when one could suffice
- **Complexity**: Some teams find PagerDuty's feature set overwhelming for simpler use cases
- **Vendor consolidation**: Organizations want fewer tools to manage
- **Open-source preferences**: Some teams prefer self-hosted or open-source solutions
