Description: A step-by-step plan for lifting applications out of virtual machines and into Docker-covering dependency discovery, data migration, image builds, smoke tests, and rollout strategies.

Every company has that VM running critical code from 2014. Containerizing it buys you reproducibility, faster deploys, and easier scaling-but only if you migrate methodically. Here’s the seven-step blueprint we follow.

## 1. Inventory and Baseline

Create a simple worksheet:

| Item | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| OS version | Ubuntu 16.04 |
| App stack | Python 3.6 + Gunicorn |
| Packages | `apt list --installed` export |
| Services | `systemctl list-units --type=service` |
| Scheduled jobs | Cron entries |
| Ports | `ss -tulpn` output |
| Data dirs | `/var/lib/app`, `/etc/app/config.yml` |

Use `osquery`, `ansible setup`, or `chef-ohai` to collect facts automatically. Classify dependencies into runtime, build-time, and host-level (kernel modules, drivers).

## 2. Extract Application Code and Configs

- Pull the latest git commit if it exists; otherwise, rsync `/opt/app`.
- Copy configs and secrets, but never bake secrets into images-store them in Vault/Secrets Manager.
- Document environment variables from `/etc/environment`, service unit files, or `.bashrc`.

## 3. Design the Container Boundary

Decide what belongs in the image vs. runtime:

- **Image:** OS packages, language runtime, application code.
- **Runtime:** Environment variables, secrets, persistent volumes, TLS certs.

Plan volumes for mutable data (uploads, caches) and map host paths or cloud storage accordingly.

## 4. Author the Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim AS base
WORKDIR /app
COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock ./
RUN pip install --upgrade pip \
 && pip install poetry \
 && poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
ENV PORT=8000
EXPOSE 8000
ENTRYPOINT ["gunicorn", "app.wsgi:application", "-b", "0.0.0.0:8000", "--workers", "4"]
```

Use multi-stage builds if you need compilation, and pin versions to keep reproducibility.

## 5. Migrate Data Safely

- Snapshot the VM and copy databases to managed services or containerized DBs.
- For file storage, sync to S3/NFS and mount into the new container.
- Run checksum comparisons to confirm parity.

## 6. Build, Test, Repeat

1. `docker build -t ghcr.io/acme/legacy-api:migration .`
2. `docker run -p 8080:8000 --env-file env/dev.env ghcr.io/acme/legacy-api:migration`
3. Execute the VM’s smoke tests (curl, integration suites, synthetic traffic).
4. Add container tests to CI so regressions stay caught.

## 7. Plan Cutover

- **Blue/Green:** Run the container alongside the VM, point a small percentage of traffic via load balancer weights.
- **Feature Flags:** Use config toggles to switch data sources or dependencies gradually.
- **Rollback:** Keep the VM snapshot ready for a quick revert.

Document operational changes (logs now in `docker logs`, metrics via cAdvisor) and update on-call runbooks.

## 8. Automate Deployments

Pick a runtime: Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, ECS, or Nomad. Define Compose/Helm manifests with resource limits, health checks, and secrets. Integrate with OneUptime for metrics and alerts.

## 9. Decommission the VM

- Freeze cron jobs.
- Archive the VM image for compliance.
- Update CMDB/asset inventory.

Only after 30+ days of stable container operations should you delete the VM to ensure no hidden dependency remains.

Migrating VMs takes patience, but the payoff is huge: reproducible builds, automated deploys, and the ability to run the same stack locally, in CI, and in production. Follow this checklist and every "mystery VM" becomes a clean container image.
