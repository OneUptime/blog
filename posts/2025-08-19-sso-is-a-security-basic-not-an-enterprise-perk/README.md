# Stop Paywalling Security: SSO Is a Basic Right, Not an Enterprise Perk

Description: SSO, SCIM, and 2FA are baseline security hygiene—not enterprise upsells. Here’s the short case and how OneUptime prices differently.

Too many (even “open source”) SaaS products still lock SSO behind an enterprise tier. That’s not clever packaging — it’s pushing smaller teams towards weaker security. Entire sites like [sso.tax](https://sso.tax/) exist because this pattern has worn out its welcome.

### Why SSO Must Be Baseline

SSO reduces credential sprawl and orphaned accounts, centralizes disable/offboarding in the IdP, cuts phishing and password‑reuse risk, and costs very little to implement today thanks to mature libraries and standard flows.

> Gating security = charging a risk tax to the teams least able to absorb breaches.

### SCIM + 2FA Belong There Too

SCIM automates birth / change / disable. 2FA blocks common takeover paths. Manual deprovisioning + no MFA is still a top incident root cause. These aren’t “automation luxuries” — they’re basic guardrails.

### What You *Should* Monetize Instead

Monetize the things that genuinely carry incremental infrastructure, regulatory, or people cost: custom data residency / region pinning, multi‑cloud or dedicated clusters, high‑volume or long‑retention audit export, priority / 24×7 escalation support, and bespoke compliance reporting or success engineering. That’s where enterprise pricing makes sense — **SSO simply isn’t in that bucket.**

### Our Approach at OneUptime

- ✅ SSO (SAML + OIDC) 
- ✅ SCIM 
- ✅ 2FA 

**All 100% free and open source.**

We charge only where we take on additional operational load (data residency, multi‑cloud orchestration, intensive audit features / requirements, premium support).


### Call to Action

If a platform gates SSO, ask why they’re pricing against your security posture. If you’re building a company: ship SSO + SCIM + 2FA along with your primary offering. **Trust is a compounding asset.**

**About OneUptime:** Reliable, secure observability for everyone. Self‑host or use the cloud. SSO free. SCIM free. 2FA free. Always! Explore at [OneUptime.com](https://oneuptime.com).
